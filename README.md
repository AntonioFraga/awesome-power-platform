## üåé Environment for learning Power Platform

Sign up for the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program) and setup Microsoft 365 dev subscription.

**Option 1 - Power Apps Trial Plan**

With this you can sign up for the trial using your personal email address, and you also get [Power Apps for Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/developer-program/microsoft-365-developer-program-faq#whats-included-in-the-developer-subscription) included in the trial. Even though the trial is only for 90 days, it will be extended indefinely, if there is [valid developer activity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/developer-program/microsoft-365-developer-program-faq#how-long-is-my-subscription-good-for-and-when-does-it-expire).

**Option 2 - Power Apps Community Plan**

Using the username and domain created for Microsoft 365 dev subscription, you can signup for [Power Apps Community Plan](https://signup.microsoft.com/signup?sku=flow_free&origin=powerappscommunity&ru=https://web.powerapps.com/community/signup) that gives you most of the features; for more details on which features are included see details [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/dev-community-plan#which-features-are-included-in-the-power-apps-community-plan).

**Difference between the two options**

Both Power Apps Plan Trial and Power Apps Community Plan are free, but are created for different purposes. Details [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/dev-community-plan#whats-the-difference-between-power-apps-plan-trial-and-power-apps-community-plan-and-which-one-should-i-sign-up-for).
